# Audio Signal Processing For Music Applications
Assignments for Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications on MTG-UPF Msc Sound And Music Computing. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: It's for my personal learning purpose only.


## Week 1 - Python and sounds
This exercise aims to get familiar with some basic audio operations using Python.

## Week 2 - Sinusoids and the DFT
Doing this exercise you will get a better understanding of the basic elements and operations that take place in the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

## Week 3 - Fourier properties
With this exercise you will get a better understanding of some of the Fourier theorems and of some useful properties of the DFT.

## Week 4 - Short-time Fourier Transform
Doing this exercise you will learn about the concept of the main lobe width of the spectrum of a window and you will better understand the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). You will also use the STFT to extract basic rhythm related information from an audio signal, implementing an onset detection function, which is one of the rhythm descriptors often used in music information retrieval to detect onsets of acoustic events.

## Week 5 - Sinusoidal model
In this exercise you will experiment with the sinusoidal model, measuring and tracking sinusoids in different kinds of audio signals. You will use the sinusoidal model to analyze short synthetic sounds with the goal to better understand various aspects of sinusoid estimation and tracking. You will experiment with different parameters and enhancements of the sinusoidal modeling approach.

## Week 6 - Harmonic model
This exercise on the Harmonic model will help you better understand the issue of fundamental frequency estimation by analyzing several sound examples with harmonic content.

## Week 7 - Sinusoidal plus residual model
In this exercise you will analyze and synthesize sounds using the Harmonic plus Stochastic (HPS) model, hpsModel.py.
